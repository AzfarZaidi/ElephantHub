                              <p>Scientific name and classification:
                                Elephants belong to the group Proboscidea(an order of large mammals that comprises the elephants and their extinct relatives. They are distinguished by the possession of a trunk and tusks)
                                Scientific nameof Elephants is Loxodonta
                                Order
                                African and Asian elephants are the only surviving members of the Order Proboscidea.
                                Species
                                Historically, elephants were classified into two species, the African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants. However, genetic research has provided new insight to elephant "relatedness" and taxonomic classification at the subspecies level.
                                African elephant classification is ongoing research. Preliminary genetic studies have indicated there are at least two subspecies of African elephants, namely the savanna (Loxodonta africana africana) and forest (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) elephants. However, elephant taxonomy may further diversify in the future, as genetic and phylogenic research indicates additional subspecies. Forest and savanna elephants are differentiated by geographic distribution and several physical characteristics.
                                African elephants inhabit the sub-Saharan regions of Africa. The savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana africana) resides on the savanna and grassy plains of east and South Africa. Forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) inhabit forested regions of central and western Africa.
                                The savanna elephant is larger than the forest subspecies. In fact, it is the largest land animal in the world. Refer to the Physical Characteristics section for in-depth differentiation between the two subspecies.
                                There are four recognized subspecies of Asian elephants, the Sri Lankan subspecies (Elephas maximus maximus) the mainland subspecies (Elephas maximus indicus), the Borneo subspecies (Elephas maximus borneensis), and the Sumatran subspecies (Elephas maximus sumatranus). However, elephant taxonomy may further diversify in the future, as genetic and phylogenic research indicates additional subspecies. The three subspecies are differentiated by geographic distribution and several physical characteristics.
                                Asian elephants inhabit the southern, eastern and southeastern parts of Asia. The Indian elephant (E.m. indicus) has the broadest distribution, extending between the southern and southeastern regions of Asia. Sumatran (E.m. sumatrensis) and Sri Lankan (E.m. maximus) elephants inhabit Sumatra and the southwestern portions of Sri Lanka respectively. Borneo elephants inhabit Sabah, Malaysia, and Kalimantan regions of Borneo.
                                The Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of all three Asian elephant subspecies. Refer to the Physical Characteristics section for in-depth differentiation between the three subspecies.
                                The Borneo elephant subspecies was identified in 2003 based on mitochondrial DNA research that distinguished them genetically from other Asian subspecies. They are the smallest in size and have the longest tail length of all four species, often touching the ground.
